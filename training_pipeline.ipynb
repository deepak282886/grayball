Earlier in the day , Rangpur Division beat Sylhet Division by six wickets in the adjacent Sylhet International Cricket Stadium , where Enamul Haque Jr became the second Bangladeshi bowler to take 500 first-class wickets . Best batters Nahidul Islam's maiden first-class century set up Khulna's big win . Having played 31 matches in seven years , Nahidul is more known for his T20 exploits in the BPL . Here , he hammered 12 fours and six sixes in his 175 , helping Khulna to 419 in the first innings . Amite Hasan got his second first-class century when he made 170 not out against Rangpur . The 20-year-old struck 17 fours in his 385-ball knock during which he spend more than eight hours at the crease , but it couldn't help Sylhet prevent the loss . Mahmudul Hasan Joy and Mominul Haque struck centuries for Chattgoram Division against Dhaka Metropolis , with the pair adding 208 runs for the third wicket . Joy made 112 with nine fours while Mominul struck 11 fours in his 103 . Dhaka Metro's Shadman Islam also made 132 off 228 balls , hitting 17 fours and a six . Sohag Gazi , playing for Barishal Division , slammed five fours and ten sixes in his 95-ball 113 , before veteran Farhad Hossain made an unbeaten 108 for Rajshahi Division in their drawn tier-2 encounter . Best bowlers Rangpur's opening pair of Robiul Haque and Mukidul Islam took seven wickets each in the game to help their side to the win . But it was Enamul who stole the limelight when he took his career tally to 500 wickets when he had Jahid Javed caught behind on the fourth day . Only Abdur Razzak , who retired earlier this year , has more first-class wickets (634) for Bangladesh . Taijul Islam , meanwhile , picked up his sixth ten-wicket haul , when he took 10 for 220 against Barisal . Monir Hossain also took a five-wicket haul in the same game . Mehidy Hasan Miraz had a good outing against Dhaka Division , taking 6 for 41 in the second innings to go with his 67 . Raihanuddin also registered a match-haul of 9 for 154 in the same game . Best match Khulna , who won the last completed NCL in 2019 , picked up their first win this season against Dhaka Division . Batting first , Khulna posted 419 all out with Nahidul's career-best 175 . Dhaka were 162 for two in reply but were shot out for 231 . Asked to follow on , Dhaka dragged the game into the fourth day but Miraz's six-wicket haul dashed their hopes , as they were bowled out for 161 . Points to ponder Rangpur are on top of tier-1's points table with 15 . 89 , followed by Khulna (13 . 75) and Dhaka (13 . 63). Barisal lead tier-2 with 16 . 9 points . Players to watch Among those who will be involved in the Pakistan Tests later this month , Mominul , Shadman , Taijul and Miraz all performed very well in this round . Allrounders Nahidul and Gazi struck centuries too . .\"}</td>\n",

During the off-season , will keep you up to date with major developments , news and the odd quirky story . Middlesex have eyes on GayleChris Gayle has been targeted by Middlesex as an overseas player ahead of the 2012 T20 season . \"f you\\'re asking whether we would like Chris Gayle in our side then yes , of course we would . \"said Middlesex\\'s director of cricket , Angus Fraser . \"ut whether we can afford him in another thing entirely . \"n the past , however , Middlesex have benefited from a partnership with the MCC whereby the burden of playing the top overseas players\\' wages has been shared between the two clubs . Adam Gilchrist was signed thanks to such a partnership . As things stand , however , Middlesex are likely to play only three of their five home games at Lord\\'s with international commitments and the Olympics limiting the ground\\'s availability . The club may even need to persuade the ECB to allow them to stage their first game a couple of weeks before the formal launch of next year\\'s event . Middlesex have already strengthened their top-order batting with the signing of Joe Denly from Kent . Fraser confirmed , however , that Andrew Strauss will not play any Twenty20 cricket in future . High-profile candidates for MCC roleSteve Elworthy , currently director of marketing and communications at the ECB , and Dave Richardson , currently the general manager of cricket at the ICC , are understood to be among the short-listed candidates for the vacant role of chief executive of the MCC . The previous CEO , Keith Bradshaw , resigned recently in order to spend more time with his family in Australia . Shanker for IPL ? You might have thought we\\'d heard the last of Adrian Shankar . After the debacle of his brief stint at Worcestershire , most people would have slunk away and got on with their life far away from the world of cricket . But not our Adrian . He\\'s nothing if not determined . It now seems that Shankar has turned his attention to the IPL and has , somehow , aroused the interest of Rajasthan Royals . As a result , Royals management have made enquiries to players in England to learn more about Shankar\\'s background . The question they asked was: is Shankar a fantastic , untapped talent who has somehow escaped the notice of all English scouts; or is he just an audacious blagger ? You can probably guess the answer they received . Moeen Ali\\'s England chanceIt might have been presumed that the likes of Monty Panesar , Samit Patel and Scott Borthwick were the men jostling for the second spinner spot in the England squad to the UAE (in January-February) and Sri Lanka (March-April). But Moeen Ali is also in contention . The 24-year-old Worcestershire allrounder took more wickets than any other off-spinner in Division One of the Championship in the 2011 season (albeit a modest 18 at 51 apiece) and also scored 930 runs at an average of 33 . That allround ability subsequently won Moeen a place in England\\'s potential performance squad and , along with a few of the other batsmen and spinners in that squad , he will remain in Sri Lanka after the three-week training camp in Colombo . The players will be allocated first-class teams and benefit from playing for another seven weeks in Sri Lankan domestic cricket . The inference is that a role in the Test side - probably batting at six and fulfilling the role of second spinner - is just about within Moeen\\'s grasp . While there are several players ahead of him in the queue at present , most have question-marks against them; Panesar , for instance , has few pretensions as a batsman or a fielder , while Patel\\'s fitness remains an issue . Whatever happens , if England do need to call upon Moeen in Sri Lanka , it will surely prove beneficial that he has experience of the conditions . It\\'s another example of the planning and attention to detail that has characterised the England management in recent years . Financial issues for WarwickshireWarwickshire have left several clubs disgruntled by their approaches for players in recent seasons , but the boot could soon be on the other foot . The failure to land an Ashes Test in 2013 will have a large impact on the finances at Edgbaston and is likely to make recruiting - and retaining - top players increasingly difficult . In the short-term , it has done little to help them secure the signing of James Taylor . Taylor is also wanted by Nottinghamshire , who won the right to host Ashes Tests in 2013 and 2015 and , as a consequence , have the certainly of a high income for the foreseeable future . In the longer-term , attention will focus on retaining Warwickshire\\'s best players . Chris Woakes , for example , is out of contract at the end of the 2012 season and is certain to attract interest from a number of other counties . As a quality allrounder who might not quite make the Test team , Woakes might even be considered one of the most valuable players in the entire county game . If Warwickshire are going to keep him , they\\'re going to need to fund the mother of all pay rises . Kartik set for Oval moveSurrey are close to securing the singing of Murali Kartik , the left-arm spinner , as an overseas player for the 2012 season . He has previously enjoyed spells at Lancashire , Middlesex and Somerset . While it is understood that Surrey\\'s salary bill remains the largest in the county game , the club have not breached the salary cap of £1 . 8.'}</td>\n",

Not since the Australian summer of 1999/2000 have these purveyors of pace faced up to each other at full fitness , and right now both are fit and bowling faster than ever before . In their first clash , Brett Lee took the honours and came away the victor . At the time , Lee was the raw rookie trying to knock the world champion off his perch , while Shoaib Akhtar had proved himself the fastest man alive . Lee\\'s sharpest delivery of that summer came in at 154 . 8kph - just pipping Shoaib\\'s 154 . 7kph , and Lee walked away as the new world champion of speed . Over the following two and a half years , the pair have swapped the title between themselves as they have notched faster , and still faster , speeds . But that 154 . 8kph from Lee has remained the fastest-recorded delivery by IDS Sports on Australian soil . In the 1998/99 season , Darren Gough was fastest on the IDS guns when he eclipsed the 150kph mark in Sydney , but only just . In the seasons to follow Lee has been fastest , recording 154 . 8kph in his rookie year , 150 . 0kph in Perth 2000/1 and 154 . 6kph in the most recent summer . Brett Lee left Australian shores and in March of this year bowled the two fastest balls of modern times at 157 . 4 and 157 . 3kph on the EDH guns in South Africa . The same guns captured Shoaib bettering these speeds just a few weeks later in Pakistan when he registered 159 . 5kph . Throughout the month of April , Shoaib was constantly in the mid-to-high 150s(kph) and surpassed Lee\\'s best on numerous occasions , EDH clocking him as high as 159 . 9kph . On April 277 , Shoaib bowled his fastest spell which included the 100 milesper-hour ball registering 161 . 0kph and 160 . 0kph with consecutive balls . These speeds were confirmed by two separate high-quality Stalker radar guns trained on each ball , whilst the EDH guns were temporarily inoperative . Once again Shoaib comes to Australia as the world\\'s fastest bowler and Lee is the challenger eager to take the title . Never before has the gulf separating these two bastions of speed been anywhere near the 3 . 6kph which exists today . But with their competitive juices flowing and bragging rights up for grabs , it should be a thrilling encounter . Even if they don\\'t come close to the 100-mph mark , we should at least see a new \\'fastest ball\\' in Australia on the IDS guns . On the under-card is the possibility of this year\\'s third fastest bowler Jason Gillespie (153 . 9kph), jostling for position with emerging star Mohammed Sami , who this year is ranked sixth with his 149 . 7kph . Both bowlers have recorded their fastest balls in their most recent international outings and both men are on the rise in what has been dubbe. \"he pace race.'}</td>\n",

       "      <td>{'text': \"Travis Head has kept up his consistent rise in the ICC Test batters' rankings , getting to a career best No . 2 at the end of the Headingley Test against England , just nine points behind Kane Williamson . England's batting stars in that Test , which they won by three wickets , were Ben Stokes and Harry Brook , and they moved up five places to 18th and one place to 12th respectively . With Williamson not having played Test cricket since March because of a right knee injury , Head has a chance of getting to the No . 1 spot by the end of the fourth Ashes Test , to be played at Old Trafford from July 19 . He has already scored 266 runs in three Ashes Tests so far , 116 of them coming in the last one . While Head sparkled , Steven Smith , Marnus Labuschagne and Joe Root had below-par outings at Headingley , and that meant a drop in the rankings for them . All of them moved down one spot - Smith to fourth , Labuschagne to fifth , and Root to sixth - and made room for Babar Azam to get to No . 3 . The Headingley Test wasn't a high-scoring one , and that was down to some special bowling performances , especially from Mark Wood . Playing his first Test since December 2022 , Wood picked up 5 for 34 and 2 for 66 , winning the Player-of-the-Match award in the process , and rose nine spots to No . 26th . His colleague Stuart Broad put in a good show too , picking up five wickets . That took him up four places to sixth . For the Australians , Pat Cummins returned 6 for 91 in the first innings , while Mitchell Starc had 2 for 59 and 5 for 78 . Cummins stayed at No . 2 , not far behind the top-ranked R Ashwin , while Starc went up three positions to 11th . .\"}</td>\n",

       "      <td>{'text': \"The worst kept secret in town ? Well not quite , but Australia's selectors have nonetheless followed the almost-universally predicted course in choosing the squad that will meet New Zealand in Brisbane in the first match of the countries' upcoming three-Test series . Injury and illness had initially threatened to throw the Australians' plans into chaos but sparkling performances in domestic cricket last weekend from fast bowler Brett Lee and batsman Damien Martyn dispelled any lingering doubts over their readiness . Martyn's fellow Western Australian , Justin Langer , also suggested that he was suffering no lasting effects from a blow to the head the previous week as he struck a brilliant century against Tasmania . And the last piece of the jigsaw will be fitted into place this weekend when captain Steve Waugh takes the field for Sydney club side Bankstown after experiencing problems with deep vein thrombosis . Most of the twelve-man squad has been in brilliant form in the domestic arena , leaving the selection panel with few headaches in assembling the team . Lee's return of 5/56 against South Australia on Sunday represented a particularly welcome boost following the speedster's comparatively disappointing tour of England and after a rib injury had made for a late start to the season . Insofar as any kind of unpredictable development has occurred , it's probably that of the inclusion of Queensland paceman Andy Bichel . Albeit that he is ultimately expected to assume the twelfth man duties , Bichel did not tour with the Australians on their recent trip to England . He is also the only player in the squad who did not feature in the country's last Test match prior to this one - the innings and 25 run thrashing of England that gave it a 4-1 victory in the 2001 Ashes series . Bichel has , in fact , not represented his country in the Test arena since playing in the fourth match of the 2000-01 series against West Indies . It's just another measure of the enduring strength of this squad , perhaps , that he claimed figures of 5/60 in the first innings of that match and yet has not been required in the eleven at any time since . The First Orange Test begins at the 'Gabba on 8 November . The full Australian squad is: Steve Waugh (c), Adam Gilchrist (v/c), Andy Bichel , Jason Gillespie , Matthew Hayden , Justin Langer , Brett Lee , Damien Martyn , Glenn McGrath , Ricky Ponting , Shane Warne , Mark Waugh . .\"}</td>\n",

       "      <td>{'text': 'Ben Stokes has now played in three World Cup finals - is that the most for England ? And who\\'s played the most all told ? asked Richard Baker from England Ben Stokes has now appeared in three World Cup finals - one of 50 overs and two T20s - and has played a central role in each . He\\'s one of five England players to have played in three , after Graham Gooch (two of 50 overs and one of 60 , all lost), Jos Buttler , Eoin Morgan and Adil Rashid . In all , 26 men have played in three World Cup finals , and four in four . But a distinguished quartet of Sri Lankans lead the way with five final appearances: Tillakaratne Dilshan , Mahela Jayawardene , Lasith Malinga and Kumar Sangakkara all appeared in the 50-over finals of 2007 and 2011 , and in the T20 in 2009 , 2012 and 2014 . In women\\'s World Cups , three Australians have played in seven finals . Alyssa Healy has appeared in six in T20s (between 2010 and 2021), to go with the 2022 50-over World Cup , in which she hammered a record 170 in the final; she has an unrivalled collection of six winners\\' medals . Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry have both played in two 50-over and five T20 World Cup finals . England scored 170 without loss to beat India last week . Was this the highest score to win a T20I by ten wickets ? asked Kris McKenzie from England England\\'s 170 for 0 to overhaul India in last week\\'s semi-final in Adelaide was a record for the T20 World Cup - it beat Pakistan\\'s 152 for 0 , also against India , in Dubai in October 2021 . But there have been two higher totals to win by ten wickets in all T20Is . The record was set only about six weeks ago: Pakistan scored 203 for 0 to defeat England (199 for 5) in Karachi in late September . The previous record was New Zealand\\'s 171 for 0 to defeat Pakistan (168 for 7) in Hamilton in January 2016 . Gibraltar , batting first , scored 213 for 0 against Bulgaria in Marsa (Malta) in May 2022 , and won by 21 runs . I was admiring Jim Laker\\'s performances in the 1956 Ashes . In five successive innings , he took 34 wickets - is this the overall record ? asked James Harrison from England The England offspinner Jim Laker holds the record for the most wickets in two successive Test innings (19 , all Old Trafford in 1956), three innings (25 wickets) and four (30; he had taken 5 for 58 and 6 for 55 in the previous Test against Australia , at Headingley). Laker then took 4 for 80 in the first innings of the fifth Test at The Oval , to give him 34 wickets in five successive Test innings , which equalled another Surrey bowler , George Lohmann , in South Africa in 1895-96 . He took 7 for 38 and 8 for 7 in Port Elizabeth , 9 for 28 and 3 for 43 in Johannesburg , and 7 for 42 in Cape Town . Laker took three wickets and Lohmann one in the sixth innings of their sequence , but have to give way to Sydney Barnes , who proved almost unplayable for England against South Africa in 1913-14 . Barnes , who had already taken ten wickets in the first Test of the series , collected 8 for 56 and 9 for 103 in Johannesburg , 3 for 26 and 5 for 102 in the next match , also in Johannesburg , and 7 for 56 and 7 for 88 in what turned out to be his final match , in Durban , giving him 39 wickets in his last six innings , and a record 49 in the series . Shakib Al Hasan scored a century and took ten wickets in a Test in Bangladesh in 2014 - how many others have done this ? asked Masud Hasan from Bangladesh Shakib Al Hasan followed an innings of 137 with 5 for 80 and 5 for 44 as Bangladesh beat Zimbabwe by 162 runs in Khulna in 2014-15 . Shakib was only the third man to score a century and take ten or more wickets in the same Test , as this list shows . England\\'s Ian Botham hit 114 in between taking 6 for 58 and 7 for 48 against India in Bombay in 1979-80 , and Imran Khan made 117 and took 6 for 98 and 5 for 82 while captaining Pakistan against India in Faisalabad in 1982-83 . The only other man to achieve th. \"atch double\" of 100 runs and ten wickets was Alan Davidson , with 80 , 5 for 135 , 44 and 6 for 87 against West Indies in the tied Test in Brisbane in 1960-61 . All the above gentlemen were preceded in women\\'s Tests by Australia\\'s Betty Wilson , who had scarcely credible figures of 7 for 7 and 4 for 9 to go with her 112 against England at St Kilda in Melbourne in 1957-58 . She was followed in 1979 by 38-year-old Enid Bakewell , who carried her bat for 112 not out in England\\'s second innings (having scored 68 in the first) and took 3 for 14 and 7 for 61 against West Indies at Edgbaston . Victoria were shot out for 63 the other day . Was this their lowest in the Sheffield Shield ? asked Marcus Corbett from Australia Victoria\\'s 63 against Queensland at the Allan Border Field in Brisbane last week was actually their fourth-lowest in the Sheffield Shield . They were skittled for 31 in 1906-07 and 35 in 1926-27 , both times by New South Wales in Sydney , and for 43 by South Australia in Melbourne in 1895-96 . None of those three lower totals was the first innings of the match , though . Victoria were 47 for 8 at lunch on the first day in Brisbane , their worst-ever start to a match . But it wasn\\'t quite a record for the domestic competition: in Sydney in 2004-05 , South Australia were bowled out for 29 in 14 . 4 overs by New South Wales , who had scored 12 for 0 themselves by lunch . They went on to a total of 430 , and won by an innings . Use our feedback form , or the Ask Steven Facebook page to ask your stats and trivia questions.'}</td>\n",
